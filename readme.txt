"AQI-AT.xlsx" file contains the training dataset, where the input data is " Air pollutant's concentration" and the output is "the absolute temperatur", and the missing data is filled by the average of the column.
Various different algorithms like LSTM, GRU, SRNN were trained on this dataset.
Further, the results of the whole project is explained in the file named " Report_Temperature prediction using...."
